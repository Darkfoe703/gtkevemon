GtkEveMon
=========

This is the README file for GtkEveMon. It covers:

* Building GtkEveMon
* Running GtkEveMon
* Installing GtkEveMon
* Uninstalling GtkEveMon


STEP 1: BUILDING
=====================================================================

GtkEveMon comes in form of source code, which is located in the "src/"
directory. The source code needs to be built in order to execute it.
The required libraries to build GtkEveMon (which can be installed
using your distribution's package management) are:

	libxml++ (with headers)
	libgtkmm (with headers, at least version 2.4)
	libcurl (with headers, compiled with encryption support)

The source does not come with a configure script. Just execute:

    $ make

To build a debug version execute:

    $ make debug

STEP 2: RUNNING
=====================================================================

Note that you DO NOT NEED to install GtkEveMon in order to use it.
If you don't want to install GtkEveMon, just execute GtkEveMon with:

    $ ./src/gtkevemon

Once you install GtkEveMon (read below), type "gtkevemon" anywhere 
in your system or make a shortcut in your window manager.


OPTION: INSTALLING
=====================================================================

Make sure your current working directory is relative to this file.
To install GtkEveMon execute the following command (as super user):

    # make install

The default location for the gtkevemon executable is "/usr/local/bin",
and the default locations for the icon and .desktop file are
"/usr/local/share/pixmaps" and "/usr/local/share/applications",
respectively.

If you want to change the default location, use the PREFIX environment
variable, or edit the Makefile directly. If unset, PREFIX Will default
to "/usr/local".

The Makefile also supports the DESTDIR variable. DESTDIR will be
prepended to PREFIX, preserving the directory structure of the
installation while installing to a non-standard location.

Configuration files as well as data files (SkillTree.xml and
CertificateTree.xml) are placed in "~/.gtkevemon" whether you
install GtkEveMon or not. This is not changeable at runtime.


OPTION: UNINSTALLING
=====================================================================

If you want to uninstall GtkEveMon, just type
following command (as super user):

    # make uninstall

This will not remove the data in your home directory.
