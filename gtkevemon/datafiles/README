This is a collection of scripts and data to create data files in a
convenient way. Version information need to be updated in the Makefile
EVERY TIME a new version of a file is released.


Files for Clients
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depending on the files that are actually changed, they need to
be uploaded to be available for clients:

- CertificateTree.xml.gz (data file for certificates)
- SkillTree.xml.gz (data file for skills)
- ItemTree.xml.gz (data file for items)

Data files are managed via the GtEveMon Versioning Backend, located:
http://gtkevemon.battleclinic.com/updates/

Currently, there is no convenient way to create ItemTree.xml.
The item_tree_xml_export.php script can be used to create a XML file
from a local MySQL database with the EVE dumps.
The EVE dumps are available from: http://eve.no-ip.de/qr100/

The current ItemTree.xml.gz is out of date. The infrastructure to parse
and provide the item tree in GtkEveMon is already there, however, it
is never used in the code.


Makefile targets explained
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Makefile has several targets to ease the progress.

make skilltree
- Creates SkillTree.xml.gz with version information

make certtree
- Creates CertificateTree.xml.gz with version information

make clean
- Cleans up all generated files
